<h2>Strategies</h2>

[! filter markdown|safe !]

- If you have black marked connection and 
skyllclamp, you can keep feeding tokens
into battle and they'll either win or
you get to draw two cards. 

- You can attack with Changeling
Outcast that can't be blocked and then use
ninjitsu to bring in another ninja.

- pretty sure one of the ninjas can 
put another ninja back in the deck 
which means you could keep cycling 
them with the skeleton creature
if they have a good __enters 
battlefield__ feature. 

- Get Sink into Stupor in the 
deck which can be played as a 
land if you need one or bounce
a nonland permanent opponent card. 

- Can attach with something and use
Vodalian Illusionist to phase
out a defender. Or, phase out
an attacking creature? 


- Use feed the swarm and reanimate
to kill a creature and then
take control of it immediately. 
Same could be done with Infernal
Grasp. 

- Tragic Slip - an instant for
1 black you can use to give
a creature -13/-13 if something
died on the turn. 

- Don't use crippling chill on your 
turn. wait until an opponent
has done their untap step. The
text says it won't untap 
during the next one so you 
get to knock something
out for two turns if I'm reading
this right. 

- If you have Shizo, Death's
Storehouse, use a black to
tap it so a creature can
attack with fear. (make sure
there aren't artifact or
other black creatures that 
can counter it. 

- use secret tunnel with
4 mana to have two creatures
that can't be blocked on the
turn. 




## Cards To Pick

These are strong contenders
for picks for the deck:

- Conspiracy turn everything
into a given type

- xenograft turns everything
into a given type

- so does the aqueous one

- amoeboid give creature types

- standardize is an instant
that can make everything a given
creature type

- Maskwood Nexus turns all the
creature you control into every
creature type. 

- leyline of transformation 
converts creatures to a specifc
type in addttion to their other
types. 

- arcane adaptation lets you choose
a creature type and make all
your creatures that type. 


- combo hivestone with artificial
evolution to make everything
ninjas (not sure it's necessary,
but it's a possibility)


- Can Irenicus' Vile Duplicataion
bring in a second legendary
that doesnt' cause it to 
bump out since it won't
be a legendary, or is the
name all that matters?



- Sakashima of a thousand faces
as a second commander so you 
get double the draws and
hits for each attack. 

- glasspool mimic - 
copy another creature or
be a land

- Fell the profane - either
destroy a target creature/planeswalker
or play as a land.

- Malakir Rebirth - either
land or allows a creature 
to come back if it dies on
the turn. 

- Hagra Mauling - can play as either
destroy a creature
or as a land

- Agadeem's Awkening - can 
either pull cards from the
graveyard or play as a land. 

- Pelakka Predation - an 
opponent reveals their hand,
you have them discard a 
card with mana value of
3 or greater

- 

- Phyrexian Arena -

in your hand.

- Soka's boomerang for tapping
a creature before someone

Pay three blue to tap all creatures

but I think you can do that
after an opponents untap step

opponent casts a spell you 
reveal top card in the library
and if manas match the spell
is countered. (feels like a free
chance to counter every spell?)

- Equilibrium - whenever you cast
a creature spell, you may
pay 1 and return target creature
to it's owner's hand. 

- Day of Dragons - 

Turns everybody into 5/5 dragons
with flying. when the enchantment
leaves, all the original creatures
come back. (feels like maybe too
costly and if you don't have a 
way to sac the enchantment it
doesn't feel worth it. would
be great for a 1-shot if
you could though.)

- Orpomancer (or whatever
the card is called)
that lets you make a 1/1
black snake with 
death touch at the start
of each upkeep so you 
can sac it.  

- Sheoldred's Edict
Each player sac either:
nontoken creature, 
creature token, or
a planeswalker. 
(Good for the sideboard)

whenever a creature you
control dies each opponent
sacs a creature

- phyresian reclamation 
1 colorless and 1 black
and 2 life returns
creature from graveyard
to hand

this can proc with the
life gain thing which

1 damage when you cast
non-creature spells

- crowded crypt 
mana or sacrafice for
draw

- infernal idol
mana or sacrafice for
draw

2 of anything turns
into 1 black for
each swamp. doesn't
proc without the
input.

add 1 colorless, or
use 3 colorless to
get one black for each
swamp you control. 

I think I like this more
than the coffers becuase
it always give you at 
least 1.
